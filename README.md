## TLDR: A simple and elegant approach to learning Successor Features ðŸŒŸ

## Introduction
Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a crucial role in enabling intelligent systems to adapt and generalize across 
diverse and changing environments. However, a fundamental challenge in RL is learning representations that are robust to 
forgetting and interference, particularly in continual learning settings.

Successor Features (SFs) offer a promising approach to mitigating these issues by decoupling representations from reward 
functions. Despite their theoretical advantages, learning SFs from high-dimensional inputs (e.g., pixels) remains difficult, 
often leading to representation collapse, where learned features fail to encode meaningful information.

In our **NeurIPS 2024 paper**, we introduce Simple Successor Features (Simple SFs)â€”a streamlined, efficient method to learn 
SFs directly from pixels, without requiring: 

1. Pre-training
2. Complex auxiliary losses such as reconstruction

## Key Contributions
- A simple yet effective modification of the Temporal-Difference (TD) loss, enabling stable SF learning from high-dimensional inputs.
- Empirical validation across various environments, demonstrating superior performance in:
  1. 2D and 3D navigation tasks
  2. Mujoco continuous control tasks
  3. Continual RL settings, where SFs reduce interference and improve transferability.
- Implementation in both PyTorch (Continuous Actions) and JAX (Discrete Actions).

## Whatâ€™s in this Repository?
This repo provides the official implementation of **Simple SFs**, including:
- PyTorch implementation for continuous action environments (adapted from the [Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB) repository](https://github.com/rll-research/url_benchmark).
- JAX (Flax) implementation for discrete action environments (coming soon!)

## Quickstart Guide 
This section provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with **Simple Successor Features (Simple SFs)**.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
We recommend using **Conda** for dependency management. To set up the environment, run:
```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
conda activate simple_sfs
```

### 2. Training Simple SFs
Once the environment is set up, start the training by running:
```bash
python full_train.python
```

### 3. Modifying Training Parameters
The configuration file full_train.yaml controls training parameters such as num_train_frames etc. 
To log and visualize training progress, set use_wandb to True. 

## Architecture & Experimental Results
The following figures illustrates the architecture of **Simple SFs** and the experimental results for the Mujoco environments. 

The architecture of **Simple SFs** follows an **actor-critic structure** for continuous actions:
